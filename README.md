# Gillespie Algorithm
 Using the Gillespie Algorithm to model various chemical reactions

The Gillespie Algorithm takes the deterministic form of modeling chemical reactions and creates a stochastic model. At each iteration in the algorithm, it calculates the propensity functions, a_j, for each reactions (numbered j = 1,2,..,M). These propensity functions are defined as the
